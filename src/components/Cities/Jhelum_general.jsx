            Jhelum is famously known as the "City of Soldiers" or "Land of Martyrs and Warriors" due to its historical contribution of a large number of soldiers to the British Army before Pakistan's independence and subsequently to the Pakistani armed forces. The city's name is believed to be derived from the words "Jal" (clean water) and "Ham" (snow), referencing the pristine waters of the Jhelum River, which originates from the snow-capped Himalayas and flows through the city. Jhelum is also an industrial hub with a variety of industries surrounding the city. These include flour mills, tobacco processing, marble, glass, and wood factories, which contribute to the local economy. The combination of its strategic location, historical significance, and industrial presence makes Jhelum a prominent city in the region.

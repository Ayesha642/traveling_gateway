          <p>
          Hyderabad is the second-largest city in Sindh and the eighth-largest in Pakistan. Established in 1768 by Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro of the Kalhora Dynasty, the city once served as the provincial capital until 1847, when the British shifted the capital to Bombay's presidency. Located approximately 150 kilometers (93 miles) from Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, Hyderabad is easily accessible via a direct railway and motorway.

          <p>
          Hyderabad is currently a major cultural and commercial center that connects urban and rural Sindh. The city is home to historical treasures such as the graves of the Talpur and Kalhora rulers, two majestic forts, and the vibrant Shahi Bazaar, renowned for its colorful and lively atmosphere. However, there are a number of historic and old marketplaces, as well as the famed Hyderabadi biryani. On the other hand, the city's stunning monuments and architecture will compel you to enjoy its charm.
